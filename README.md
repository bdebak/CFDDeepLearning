# CFDDeepLearning

CFDDeepLearning is an attempt to narrow the gap between mathematics and deep learning by trying to solve Navier-Stokes equations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
Neural Network has come to a maturity level where it can solve problems where traditional algorithms fail or give less performance. There is a great opportunity for mathematics to bring new tools and ideas in this area, by doing so, it could be beneficial to Neural Networks in general and deep learning in particular for us to understand the underlying patterns of this rather new field.

Deep Neural Network relies on a strong regularity assumption on the nature of the data. When computing weights, DNN find diffeomorphisms that are invariants under certain conditions, and thus are able to represent input data in sub-spaces that are workable. Specifying the regularity for every problem is a central mathematical topic. Under regularity assumptions we can reduce the model uncertainty or bias, controlling the fluctuations of the predictions is managed by increasing the model complexity. This bias-variance dilemma is solved by finding a compromise model. However, an evaluation of the algorithm uncertainties is also difficult to solve. Bayesian approaches have become popular in estimating the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainties, while other approaches are beginning to emerge as well.
