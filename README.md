# CFDDeepLearning

CFDDeepLearning is an attempt to narrow the gap between mathematics and deep learning by trying to solve Navier-Stokes equations of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD).
Neural Network has come to a maturity level where it can solve problems where traditional algorithms fail or give less performance. There is a great opportunity for mathematics to bring new tools and ideas in this area, by doing so, it could be beneficial to Neural Networks in general and deep learning in particular for us to understand the underlying patterns of this rather new field.

## How to use this module

The module comprises a serie of jupyter notebooks with different topics, users are free to experiment and insert their own code as well.
